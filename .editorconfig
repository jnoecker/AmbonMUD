# ── Relaxed ktlint rules ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# These three standard rules cause excessive reformatting friction
# (especially in PRs and AI-assisted workflows) without meaningful
# readability benefit for this project.  Disabling them allows authors
# to use their judgement for wrapping while ktlint still enforces the
# high-value rules: trailing commas, no wildcard imports, spacing,
# blank-line placement, indentation, etc.
#
# multiline-expression-wrapping: forced newline after `=` when the RHS
#   wraps to multiple lines.
# string-template-indent: depends on multiline-expression-wrapping
#   being loaded; must be disabled together (ktlint #2288).
# chain-method-continuation: every `.call()` in a chain must be on its
#   own line — too aggressive for short 2-3 element chains.
# function-signature: forces each parameter onto its own line when the
#   signature doesn't fit on one line — inflates single-param functions.
