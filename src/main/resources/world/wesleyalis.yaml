The air is warm and alive with insects and birdcall. An archway of intertwined jungle vines frames the eastern path — beyond it, dimensional light pulses faintly, the gateway back to the wider world. A jewel-toned chameleon watches you from a branch, then vanishes. To the west, the road continues deeper into the kingdom."

Through the canopy above, the underside of the treehouse is visible: a vast golden-timbered platform lashed to a tree so large it defies explanation. A rope ladder dangles northward to a landing platform. The road continues east; a woodpile is to the west; a smoky smell drifts from the south."

The logs are arranged in interlocking layers that — if you look at the cut ends — spell out 'W+A' near the top. A smell of fresh-cut pine and resin mingles with the humid jungle air. Butterflies and luminous tropical moths flutter between the logs. A scarlet macaw has claimed the topmost piece as a throne. The gravel road is east; the smoker is south."

Someone has chalked a menu on a slab of bark propped against it: 'BBQ Ribs, Wings, Dino Nuggets (the big kind).' The coals glow orange in the canopy-filtered light. The rich, layered smell of smoke and slow-cooked everything is extremely persuasive. The wood pile is back to the north."

The platform is solid and well-worn, hung with wind chimes made of shells and old keys that keep up a gentle music in every breeze. Painted arrows point in three directions with helpful labels: 'UP (treehouse)', 'DOWN (road)', and 'IN (basement, servants only — do not knock before 7am).'

The smoke drifts in from the south, smelling of something ancient and sweet — flowers that haven't existed for sixty-five million years. The ground is soft with centuries of leaf litter, and enormous tracks cross the clearing in patterns too large for any modern animal. It is beautiful and faintly alarming. The gravel road lies to the north; the smoke thickens to the south."

The bees themselves are prehistoric: each one wider than your arms spread wide, their drone a bass note that resonates in your chest. In the center, on a platform of pure golden comb, the Prehistoric Queen Bee tends her domain with the authority of sixty-five million years of unbroken succession. Jars of luminous honey and a shed stinger the size of a sword lie near the entrance. The jungle extends east and west; the smoky clearing is back to the north."

A hunting velociraptor pauses to assess you with unsettling intelligence. A triceratops grazes at the far edge of a sunny clearing, deceptively peaceful. This is not a safe place, but it is magnificent. The apiary is to the west; the high canopy is to the north."

Wind chimes keep up a gentle bamboo music. Someone has painted a large sign on the trunk in careful letters: 'KINGDOM OF WESLEYALIS — WESLEY & AURORA, RULERS OF EVERYTHING.'

A floating code overlay hovers at the edge of your vision, written in a syntax that looks like it was designed by someone who learned programming before handwriting.

    title: "The Tantrum Wasteland"
    description: "This corner of Aurora's kingdom has borne the full weight of toddler displeasure, and it shows. Stuffed animals lie strewn across the floor as if thrown by a tiny, furious god — which is accurate. The bookshelf is empty, its contents scattered in a radius consistent with a toddler having Extremely Strong Opinions. Crayon marks cover the wall in bold, righteous arcs. And yet — even in destruction there is artistry. The pattern follows the logic of pure indignant feeling, and is, in its own way, beautiful and terrible. Small chaos toddler spirits dance through the debris. The stuffie wonderland is west."

  # ─── THE BASEMENT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    description: "The basement of the Kingdom of Wesleyalis is the domain of the Royal Servant Parents, and they have tried their best with it. One corner has a proper adult workspace: a laptop, paperwork of obscure but essential importance, and a coffee mug that has not been fully empty since approximately the birth of Wesley. The walls bear evidence of both kingdoms above leaking downward — here a framed dinosaur drawing, there a stuffed bear keeping dignified watch from a high shelf. A whiteboard reads: 'CURRENTLY RUNNING: 2 KINGDOMS, 1 TREEHOUSE, 1 PREHISTORIC APIARY, MISC. DINOSAURS.' The dining room is above; the landing side door is south; the art archive is east; the stuffie nook is west."

    title: "The Basement Art Archive"
    description: "A section of the basement has been given over — voluntarily or otherwise — to the overflow of Wesley's art production. Portfolios stand in labeled folders. Rolled canvases lean against the wall. A large flat-file cabinet holds years of drawings organized by a system that makes complete sense to its creator. On the wall, framed and labeled with hand-written museum placards, are the first three drawings Wesley ever made: abstract, energetic, and signed in very large letters. The archive continues upstairs and in every available direction. The main basement is to the west."

    title: "The Basement Stuffie Nook"
    description: "The western corner of the basement has been claimed by overflow stuffies — the ones that couldn't fit in Aurora's room, a situation everyone considered mathematically impossible until it happened. They sit on shelves, in baskets, and in a large bean bag designated 'THE STUFFIE CHAIR' by a hand-painted sign. A mural at child-height on the wall shows the stuffie family tree: a genealogy of plush spanning a remarkable number of species. Several stuffies watch you from the shelves with the dignified patience of things that are very, very loved. The main basement is to the east."
