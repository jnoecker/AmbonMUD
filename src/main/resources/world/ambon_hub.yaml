    title: "Hall of Portals"
    description: "A circular hall of pale stone and humming air. Archways ring the room like a compass rose, each inset with a different lintel carving—some blank, some half-formed, all waiting for destinations. A placard reads: 'AMBONMUD DEMO HUB — Choose a doorway and step through.'"

    title: "Blank Arches"
    description: "Unkeyed archways stand here like paused sentences. New chalkwork now marks several passages for low-rank adventurers, each arch pulsing with a different color of mist."

    title: "Wayfinder Gallery"
    description: "A narrow gallery lined with relief maps of places that don't exist yet. A brass needle floats over each plaque, twitching toward the hall as if eager to be used."
