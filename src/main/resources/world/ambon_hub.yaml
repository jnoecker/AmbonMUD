        text: "Each archway leads to a different realm. The northern passage opens into the fae wood — home of Aineroia, Lady of the Fae Wood. The southern arch leads to the Kingdom of PBrae — a castle in the mountains. East leads to a scholar's retreat. West, through the gallery, is the Kingdom of Wesleyalis — a treehouse in a prehistoric rainforest. And below — through the trapdoor in the floor — lies the Kingdom of Trailey: a spy compound disguised as a very boring suburb."

The western arch there opens into the Kingdom of Wesleyalis — a massive treehouse in a prehistoric rainforest, ruled by King Wesley the Artist and Princess Aurora. Ancient bees the size of horses. Dinosaurs in the deep jungle. Paintings that come to life. Proceed with respect for art."

Ruled by King Trevor and Queen Hailey. Trevor maintains a mechanical shooting range and a roughhousing pit with a very large, very enthusiastic opponent. Hailey's zone is a competition gymnasium inside a human-scale dollhouse, with the finest perfume vault in any known dimension. Upstairs, Humpty Dumpty refuses to stay fallen. Approach all three with appropriate readiness."

      advice:
        text: "The south arch leads to the Kingdom of PBrae — the mountain pass and gravel road are gentle enough for new adventurers. Pick up equipment as you find it, and don't be afraid to flee from fights you can't win. Leveling up makes you stronger — check your 'score' often."

    title: "Hall of Portals"
    description: "A circular hall of pale stone and humming air. Archways ring the room like a compass rose, each inset with a different lintel carving. A placard reads: 'AMBONMUD DEMO HUB — Choose a doorway and step through.' Northern light filters green through fae leaves. Eastern light smells of old books. Southern light carries mountain air and the faint crunch of gravel. Western light is warm, tropical, and faintly buzzes. In the center of the floor, a trapdoor — sealed with a welcome mat that reads 'HOME' — descends to an entirely different kind of neighborhood."

    description: "Unkeyed archways stand here like paused sentences. New chalkwork marks several passages for low-rank adventurers, each arch pulsing with a different color of mist. To the west, an archway framed with painted vines and tropical flowers hums with warm, buzzing energy — beyond it, distant birdcall and the smell of rainforest and something ancient and sweet."

    description: "A cozy common room filled with the scent of woodsmoke and fresh bread. Low beams cross the ceiling, hung with dried herbs. A fire crackles in a broad hearth and mismatched chairs cluster around worn tables. The innkeeper stands behind a short counter, ready to help. A sign on the wall reads: 'RENT A ROOM — type recall anytime to return here.'"
