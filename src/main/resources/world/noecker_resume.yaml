GATEWAY mode runs the transports and talks to a remote ENGINE over a gRPC bidirectional stream. This split lets you scale engines and gateways independently, and add Redis for cross-process pub/sub."

The gateway receives the redirect, tears down local session routing, and reconnects the player's socket to the target engine's gRPC stream. The target engine loads the player from the persistence layer and picks up the session. The whole thing needs to complete fast enough that the player just experiences a slightly sluggish room transition."
