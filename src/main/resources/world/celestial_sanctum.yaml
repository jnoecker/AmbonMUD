  cloudgate:
    title: "The Cloudgate"
    description: "You stand on a platform of compacted cloud, impossibly solid underfoot. A soft luminous light fills the air from no particular direction, warm and sourceless. The world below is visible through gaps in the cloud floor — cities and forests and oceans, all distant and calm. You have arrived in a place not meant for mortals."

  divine_courtyard:
    title: "Divine Courtyard"
    description: "A vast open courtyard of white stone that has never known rain or wind, ringed by columns too tall to see the tops of. The air tastes faintly of ozone and something older. A motionless guardian watches from the far side. Paths lead to the grand hall to the north, the forge to the east, and a garden to the west."

  hall_of_glory:
    title: "Hall of Glory"
    description: "A colonnaded hall of breathtaking proportion, its vaulted ceiling painted with murals depicting the history of the divine in strokes of gold and deep blue. Display stands line the walls, each bearing an example of a god-tier weapon or piece of armor under a cone of warm light. The Divine Keeper presides here, ready to equip those of sufficient station."

  celestial_forge:
    title: "The Celestial Forge"
    description: "The forge burns with a white-blue fire that produces no smoke and leaves no ash. Hammers of impossible size hang on the walls, sized for hands that do not belong to humans. The anvil is a single block of ore from a dead star, and the stone around it is scorched in a pattern that looks deliberately artistic."
    exits:
      w: divine_courtyard

  vault_of_relics:
    title: "Vault of Relics"
    description: "A circular chamber with locked vitrines along every wall, each holding items from ages predating the current world. Most of the vitrines are empty. A few hold things that should not be examined too closely. The air is very still here, as if time is moving more carefully."
    exits:
      w: hall_of_glory

  sky_throne:
    title: "The Sky Throne"
    description: "A chamber dominated by an enormous throne of pale stone and polished bone, its back tall enough to scrape the arched ceiling. From the open balcony behind the throne, the whole world is spread below like an illuminated map. The view is humbling. The throne itself radiates a quiet authority even now, unoccupied."

  cloud_garden:
    title: "Cloud Garden"
    description: "A garden grown on a wide shelf of cloud, its beds filled with flowers that do not exist below the cloud layer: luminous white starbloom, slow-burning ember roses, and great swaths of something that looks like sky made into petals. The air here is quiet even by celestial standards."
    exits:
      e: divine_courtyard

  sky_observatory:
    title: "Sky Observatory"
    description: "The highest point in the sanctum, open on all sides to the boundless sky. A great armillary sphere of golden rings turns slowly in the center, tracking movements of bodies too distant for most to care about. The horizon curves visibly from here. Below, far below, you can see the whole of the world — kingdoms, oceans, and the faint glow of cities. It is easy to feel very powerful from up here. It is easy to feel very small too."
