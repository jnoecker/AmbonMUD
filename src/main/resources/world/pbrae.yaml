Every stuffed animal that ever mattered in the history of Braelynn's kingdom has found its way here — bears, bunnies, unicorns, one extremely specific llama. They sit in peaceful congress, debating stuffie matters of great importance. A magical giant stuffed bear guards the central clearing with fierce love. Queen Braelynn's Chamber is to the east."

A friendly noob in full gear wanders past, waving. The buildings around the plaza are charmingly oversized, their pixel-brick facades painted in candy colors. The Adopt Me!

Legendary pets drift through the air on shimmering wings. Someone nearby is trading a Neon Dragon for a Shadow Dragon; the negotiation appears to be ongoing. The neon lights are warm and the grass is very, very green. The Plaza is to the east."

The upper platforms are, frankly, a test of character. At the very top, something wonderful awaits. Jump the gaps, dodge the spinners, do not fall.

The Royal Goblet of PBrae gleams here, waiting. You made it. The Obby is below."

A Minecraft-style dirt path winds between feeding stations. Hens move with the purposeful energy of birds who have somewhere important to be, even when they don't.

A painted wooden coat of arms on the wall depicts a bronze turkey crowned and holding a Minecraft diamond in one wing and a Roblox crown in the other. A gobbling bronze turkey surveys his domain with obvious self-regard. Hen House north; Duck Nook west; Turkey Roost east; Egg Vault south."

The beams overhead are thick and wide, and the turkeys have established their preferred spots — several beams sport small hand-painted name tags ('Henry,' 'Gobbles,' 'Sir Wattles'). A speckled turkey hen regards you with sleepy, judgmental dignity. Rooster's Domain north; Turkey Hall west; Dream Portal south."

Beyond it — visible in flickers — are images: a penguin wearing a crown, a glowing diamond, a rocket car scoring an impossible goal, a stuffed bear waving cheerfully. The birds will not go near it. The turkeys say it smells like dreams. It does. Turkey Roost is north; Egg Vault is west."
