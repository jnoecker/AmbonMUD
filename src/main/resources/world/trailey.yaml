Every mailbox is the same colonial brass at the same height facing the same direction. Strangely, no matter which direction you walk — north, south, west — you find yourself standing in front of the same house, which is, in fact, every house. The neighborhood watches from behind identical blinds. A concealed staircase behind a regulation-height hedge rises upward to somewhere considerably more interesting. The driveway of the house to the east is where things begin."

    description: "A regulation-width concrete driveway, sealed and re-sealed to the HOA's exacting standards. Two faint tire tracks mark the path of a very sensible sedan. The surface is immaculate — no oil stains, no chalk drawings, no evidence that children have ever existed here, which is suspicious given what's inside. A subtle seam in the concrete near the garage suggests considerably more going on underground than the exterior implies. The cul-de-sac is west; the parking pad and garage are ahead; the sidewalk runs south."

A worn patch of grass from repeated running starts. Chalk gymnastics floor exercise outlines in one corner. The deck of the house is accessible west.

The safety net has two repaired sections and one small hole that everyone agreed was fine. Spring pockets around the frame hold assorted stuffed animals and action figures trapped there for years, their tiny faces pressed against the net with resigned acceptance. A squirrel that bounced onto the mat at some point appears to have been here for a while and has developed an opinion about the experience. Small rubber feet marks indicate exactly where to jump for maximum height. The back yard is north."

A full-length workbench holds mechanical components, disassembled electronics, and a schematic board covered in revisions. The vehicle bay holds something low-slung and fast under a fitted cover.

A supply depot — disguised as an ordinary coat closet — opens automatically after three seconds of standing in front of it. A surveillance drone hovers near the ceiling, assessing.

The foyer is west; the kitchen service entry is north; the main kitchen ops area is east.

Underwater lighting gives the surface a cold, precise glow. Lane ropes define lap lanes, but the diving end has a board and a deep section clearly intended for less efficient purposes. At the very bottom of the deep end, almost invisible through the water, is a seam in the pool floor that looks very much like a hatch. Whether it leads anywhere is left as an exercise for the curious. The deck is north."

Framed family photos line the hallway, except that in several of them, one parent appears to be somewhere classified.

Perched at the very top, dangerously near the edge, sits Humpty Dumpty: vast, egg-shaped, waistcoated, and visibly cracked along the left side. The fracture keeps spreading and sealing itself in a loop that has clearly been running for quite some time. He regards you with the smug confidence of someone who has heard the ending of his own story and believes he will be the exception. 'Nobody puts Humpty back together quite like Humpty,' he says. He is incorrect, but he doesn't know that yet. The landing is back west; east leads to where he falls."

The floor shows the evidence of many repeated catastrophic reassemblies: hairline cracks in every tile, impact marks on the walls at egg-sized heights, plaster dust drifted into corners. And yet nothing stays apart for long. Shell fragments skitter across the floor toward each other with alarming purpose. Each one that reassembles immediately evaluates the situation and turns toward you. The yolk, evidently, has a very long memory. A piece of shell sits in the far corner, inscribed on the inner surface with tiny, increasingly despairing text. The Wall is back west."

Two corridors branch from here: east leads toward a doorway framed in pink light and the distant sound of competition floor music — Hailey's zone.

The walls are silver damask; the floor is white marble; the lighting comes from chandeliers that are unreasonably elegant for a basement.

A sentient perfume cloud drifts among the bottles with proprietary intensity. Competition leotards hang in a dedicated wardrobe, size-sorted in clear garment bags labeled with the meet and the score.

Spring floor in regulation 12-by-12, chalk-line border crisp. A balance beam at regulation height runs the full east wall length. Uneven bars hang at regulation spacing beneath a ceiling that is somehow much higher than it should be. A vault with approach runway fills the south section. The Balance Beam Automaton — a robotic gymnast maintaining the equipment and guarding the training floor with the form and dignity of a Level 10 athlete — patrols the beam at all times.

    title: "Trevor's Zone - Entry Range"
    description: "The transition from Hailey's zone to Trevor's is immediate and unambiguous. Marble ends. Industrial rubber flooring begins. The walls are bare concrete block hung with target posters, range safety rules in large print, and a hand-drawn mechanical diagram that has been revised so many times it is mostly revision marks. Mechanical deer and duck targets move through the range on programmable tracks, resetting with a satisfying clank when hit. The smell is machine oil, rubber, and the warm ozone tang of electronics at operating temperature. The basement landing is north; the main range is south; the roughhousing pit is east."

    title: "The Mechanical Shooting Range"
    description: "A professional-grade indoor range configured entirely for mechanical targets. Target tracks run at five distances from 10 to 50 yards, each loaded with a different robot creature: mechanical deer glide between timber cutouts, duck targets pop from foam blinds, and in the far lane, something larger and faster runs a wolf-shaped silhouette program. A supply station holds Trevor's tactical paintball marker and a rack of protective gear. The armory and wolf-bot workshop are in the back room to the west. The entry range is north."

    title: "The Robot Armory and Workshop"
    description: "The workshop behind the range is where the machines are built and maintained. Work tables hold disassembled components: a half-finished rabbit target, the torso section of something that will eventually be larger than a person, wiring looms in labeled bundles. Precision spring coils and mechanism parts fill small labeled bins. The Alpha Wolf-Bot Mark VII stands in the charging alcove at the back wall, eyes dark but servos humming faintly at idle. It is larger up close than it looked on the range. The range is back east."

    title: "The Roughhousing Pit"
    description: "The Roughhousing Pit is exactly what the name suggests, engineered to contain it. The walls are padded foam three feet thick. The floor is crash mat over crash mat, eight layers deep. Obstacles — foam cubes, a tilting platform, monkey bars bolted to the ceiling — make it navigable only by the confident and the committed. At the center, Big Biff the Roughhousing Inflate-O-Goon sits on a beanbag the size of a small car, eating a sandwich with enormous contentment. He appears to be made of something that yields on impact and then springs back considerably harder. He has the cheerful energy of someone who genuinely loves roughhousing and is honestly excited to see you. A deflated remnant near the door suggests how previous visits ended. The entry range is west."
